# Hey there, I'm Ritesh! 👋

I’m a **computational physicist** who loves turning complex math into fast, efficient code.

By day, I’m wrapping up my PhD at the [University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/physics/), where I simulate black holes and run heavy calculations on supercomputers. By night, I tinker with deep learning and data science projects.

Basically, I like making computers solve hard physics problems—fast. 🚀

### ⚡ What I'm up to
* **Simulating the Universe:** I build "surrogate models" (think: AI emulators for physics) to predict gravitational waves without waiting weeks for simulations to finish.
* **High-Performance Computing:** I specialize in parallel computing (MPI, Slurm) and GPU acceleration. If it runs slow, I fix it.
* **Data Science:** Recently, I've been working on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to detect financial fraud.

### 🛠️ My Toolbox
* **Languages:** Python (7+ years), C, Bash.
* **The Heavy Lifters:** PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas.
* **Dev Ops:** Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Apptainer/Docker.
* **Physics:** General Relativity, Black Hole Perturbation Theory.

### 📬 Let's Chat
I'm always down to talk about physics, coding, or the latest in tech.
